YLE Areena plugin for Kodi
===

At the moment very minimal implementation of YLE Areena using the official YLE API.

In order to use this, you need to request api key from yle, and put the information 
to a file called credentials.py. A sample is provided in file credentials.py.sample.
To request API keys, go to http://developer.yle.fi/

Some content is not playable via the API, for example, news and sports news. Also,
content seems to appear to the lists before it is actually playable.
